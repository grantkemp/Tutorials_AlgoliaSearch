##Instant Search Tutorial

*Based on : https://www.algolia.com/doc/tutorials/ios-instant-search#UI

###Tech Investigation into algolia
I am currently looking at Search providers to integrate into apps, so this is the tutorial from their sit
for others who are interested in kicking the tyres on it, quite quickly. 

##Notes and Feedback
- Recommend that they add the link to Github for the resulting code at top of Demo
- Tutorial needs to be updated to include the Search Bar/ Search Display controller in latest Xcode eg : https://github.com/algolia/algolia-swift-demo
