##Instant Search Tutorial

*Based on : https://www.algolia.com/doc/tutorials/ios-instant-search#UI

###Tech Investigation into algolia
I am currently looking at Search providers to integrate into apps, so this is the tutorial from their sit
for others who are interested in kicking the tyres on it, quite quickly. 

###Notes and Feedback on the Tutorial
- Recommend that they add the link to Github for the resulting code at top of Demo
- Tutorial needs to be updated to include the Search Bar/ Search Display controller in latest Xcode eg : https://github.com/algolia/algolia-swift-demo
- Pod for algolia search client in the tutorial seems to be erroring - recommend update to the latest: pod 'AlgoliaSearch-Client-Swift', '~> 2.0' in the tutorial which builds ok. 
- The Algolia Methods are difficult to identify - it would be a nice touch to add Algolia or AS before the method to aid readability of the code

###UI within Algolia Platform
- If a user has already created an application -there is no easy way to create a new application to do the tutorial or even delete and reset their account. If they try- then they are threatened with having their credit card immediately charged. ( not very friendly and usable for developers learning to use the platform)
- They also can't easily find a link to contact support. Its very well hidden! - Should be much easier to see support to encourage people engage and evangelise.
